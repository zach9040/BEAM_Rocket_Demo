    <p> In this module, we will be learning about forces!</p>

    <p>
        What is a force? A <b>force</b> is something that causes an object to experience a change in motion. For example, if I throw a football,
        my arm is applying a force that makes the football travel through the air. Can you think of other examples of forces?
    </p>

    <p> Here are some more examples of forces: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pushing your grocery cart when you're at the store.</li>
        <li>Extending your leg muscles to jump up off the ground.</li>
        <li>Pulling the door open so that you can enter.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Forces have a very special property - if one object, let's call it object 1, exerts a force on a different object, object 2, then object 2
        exerts an <b>equal</b> force on object 1, but in the <b>opposite direction</b>. This is known as <b>Newton's Third Law. An easy way to remember it is "every action has an equal and opposite reaction".</b>
        <br> </br>
        <img id="yt-video" width="504" height="390" src="https://www.seminarsonly.com/Engineering-Projects/Physics/third-law-of-motion_clip_image004.jpg">
    <p>
        What is an example of Newton's Third Law? If you are rowing a boat, you are using your paddle to pull the oar through the water, and that
        leads to the boat moving in the opposite direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Newton's Third Law is very important for rockets. When a rocket needs to take off, the fuel inside of the rocket combusts. This converts
        the fuel into very hot gas. The rockets have an opening, called the nozzle, which creates a force and allows the gas to flow out. By Newton's
        Third Law, an equal force in the opposite direction is created, which is why the rockets lift off of the ground!
    </p>

    <p>This force that causes the rockets to move up has a special name. We call it <b>thrust</b>.

    <p>
        In this video, we will visualize the force of thrust by using a balloon. The air will come out of the back of the balloon, and thrust will cause
        the balloon to move forward.
    <p>

        <br> </br>

    <p>
        In this module, we will be reinforcing our knowledge of forces and <b>Newtonâ€™s Third Law</b> and
        how they relate to propulsion by designing paper rockets. We will practice the engineering
        design process and design the optimal <b>paper rocket</b> that will fly the farthest!
    </p>

    <p>
        So, how are rockets launched? In the first place, for a rocket to blast off, a force must be applied to luanch it into space.
        The gasses normally ejected from a rocket end up pushing it upwards due to <b>Newton's Third Law</b>. This opposite force
        is called <b>thrust</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        People often think the flames of a rocket are what actually propel it, but they're actually mistaken.  The force of
        <b>thrust</b>, caused by the gasses shot out, are what really propel the rocket upwards.  In this module, we will be obtaining the thrust from
        the air we are blowing into the straw.
    </p>

    <h2 id="module-3-bottle-rockets">Module 3: Bottle Rockets</h2>

    <p>In this module, we'll use everything we've learned about forces, thrust, and Newton's Third Law to launch powerful <b>bottle rockets!</b></p>

    <br> </br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" id="yt-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGES_59HC28" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay;
  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br> </br>

    <p>
        So how does our bottle rocket fly so high? Our rockets start out filled with water. As we pump air into the bottle, it builds up <b>pressure</b>
        inside. When the rocket is released, that pressure escapes. Water shoots out downwards from the bottom of the rocket. Remember <b>
            Newton's Third
            Law
        </b>? Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The water flying out of the bottom creates <b>thrust</b>, pushing the rocket up into the air.
    </p>

    <p>
        With our paper rockets in module 2, the thrust came from blowing into the straw. All of the thrust was at the beginning of the launch. With
        our bottle rocket, the thrust keeps going until the bottle runs out of water. With more thrust, the bottle rocket flies higher and longer!
    </p>

    <h2 id="module-4-rocket-simulation">Module 4: Rocket Simulation</h2>

    <p>
        For our last activity, we will be using what we learned above to build our own rockets (virtually)! Computer simulations are a very powerful tool that allows
        us to test designs and ideas before building them. This is very important in real life rocket science. Why? Building rockets is very expensive and takes lots of time,
        so it's very helpful to test our designs online to make sure our designs work before using the resources to make it for real.
    </p>

    <p> As you build your online rocket, think about these questions as you figure out how to make the rocket go higher!</p>

    <p><b>Hover over each question to see the answer. </b></p>

    <p class="Q1">Question 1: Why don't we just make a really big rocket and use lots of fuel?</p>

    <p class="hide">
        There's a few reasons. For one, rocket fuel is very expensive. NASA spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on rocket fuel already, so one of their
        goals is to make the rocket go as high as possible while also saving some money. Another reason is that fuel has mass, so a very big rocket will be much heavier.
        This will increase the force of gravity on our rocket, which will prevent us from going as high as we need.
    </p>

    <p class="Q2">Question 2: What is the ideal shape for the top of the rocket?</p>

    <p class="hide">
        We want to use a cone! Cones are better than flat surfaces since cones minimize forces of drag, since they help guide the air around the rocket,
        rather than blocking it like a flat surface does.
    </p>

    <p class="Q3">Question 3: How is the width of the rocket important?</p>

    <p class="hide">
        The width of the rocket should not exceed the diameter of the nose cone! Why? If it's wider than the nose cone, then there will be a flat surface
        on the side that causes drag. We want the width of the rocket to be as narrow as possible, but it still must be large enough to hold the fuel, and the people/satellites
        that are being sent into space.
    </p>

    <p class="Q4">Question 4: Should we have fins on our rocket?</p>

    <p class="hide">
        Fins are important since they help stabilize the rocket. If a rocket takes off and it's windy outside, there will be air not only on top of the rocket, but on the side.
        If there's too much wind, the rocket may wobble in the air, which can cause problems with the flight. The fins provide a force that counters the wobble, and as we learned earlier, if
        forces cancel each other out, then there won't be any movement. Some modern rockets, like the SpaceX Falcon 9, don't use fins, but stabilize the rocket using something called thrust
        vector control. Feel free to search up some YouTube videos to see how that works!
    </p>

    <p>
        Your goal is to make your rocket go as high as possible! Every time you launch a rocket, think about went well and what did not go well, and why. Then,
        keep on updating your simulation accordingly to improve your rocket's performance!
