# BEAM_Rocket_Demo
Site Project for BEAM Fall 2020
Made by Ishan Gurnani, Zachary Huang, Parker Lum, and Jacob Yim.

## Website
Web version of BEAM's *Blast Off with BEAM!* lesson. Teaches physics concepts, including force, Newton's Third Law, and thrust, ending with a bottle rocket experiment.

## Simulation
Simulates an animated rocket launch with interchangable parts. Rocket launch height varies based on the parts chosen. See how high your rocket can go!
